**Hi!** This is supposed to be my first post on this new blog. Previously, i was writing on <a href='https://ahmetgdy.wordpress.com/' target='_blank'>this site</a>. 

  Then i saw **github pages**, i really liked the domain name. And the writing with MarkDown made me move my blog here. I hope to write notes for myself, and if i could find time, i'll try to write short-posts or tutorials about Web-Development, RESTful architectures, Database, Functional Programming and maybe Game Development.

  This is it for now, hope to see you on the next post.
