    Do yourself a favor, and track what you do.

As software developers, we always look for how we can be more productive. Well, i guess that we have a common problem, **Browsing Web Steals Our Time**

Actually i have a hunger for software development, but let's say i check my email, i see something new and when i searching for time, i lose a little time. That's something i can not endure, so i met with [Rescue Time](http://rescuetime.com/) 

    It does log what you do on computer.

It's amazing, logs Visual Studio Code, stackoverflow, you name it. And this is an opportunity for you to track yourself.This is not the only thing of course.

    Pomodoro Timer.
Work 25 minutes, give short breaks for 5 minutes. On the 3rd break, you give a long break, **15** minutes. I already use [Kanban Flow](http://kanbanflow.com), and it has a built-in **Pomodoro Timer**.

I think that covers it, there are of course other alternatives, search them and i think it is a **must** for us to track what we do.

See you on the next post!
