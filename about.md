### Who is this anyway?

Hey, I'm Ahmet Gökdayı. I do develop solutions for complex problems, by coding of course. Platform does not matter actually, but if i could choose, i'd develop everything on web, i just like it.

I'm a lead game developer at [Eyula](http://eyula.com). I also work on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, PCG and all that fun stuff, but still working, cuz they're a little bit hard to implement :) If you have a question or something just send me an email, feel free.
